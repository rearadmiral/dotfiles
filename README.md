TNTC but here are some:

- [Jessica Deen's Badass Terminal](https://jessicadeen.com/macos-ohmyzsh-tmux-vim-iterm2-powerlevel9k-badass-terminal/)
  - I don't use vim very much so I skipped that but otherwise the entire beginning was perfect (especially her custom font)
  - I subbed [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline)
- [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - before I used this, configuring zsh was a huge PITA
